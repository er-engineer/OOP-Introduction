# OOP Introduction
 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hi, this repository is about understanding the **principles of object oriented programming**. Concept of the app in this repository is manipulating customer datas of a corporation.  
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Customers can be individual and corporate so I decided to give them accounts. Accounts must have an owner.  While adding a new customer or like I say account, it checks the ID number of the person who owns it but the app only checks for **Turkish** people. 
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;To simulate this stiuation, I created an ArrayList and added people randomly. Authentication and simple logging system works fine.
