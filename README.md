<h1> OOP Introduction </h1>
Hi, this repository is about understanding the principles of object oriented programming. Concept of the app in this repository is manipulating customer datas of a corporation.  
Customers can be individual and corporate so I decided to give them accounts. Accounts must have an owner. While adding a new customer or like I say account, it checks the ID number of the person who owns it but the app only checks for Turkish people.
To simulate this situation, I created an ArrayList and added people randomly. 

Authentication and simple logging system works fine.
